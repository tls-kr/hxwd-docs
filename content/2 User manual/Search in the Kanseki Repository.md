The [Kanseki Repository](https://kanripo.org) is a text database of pre-modern Chinese texts, which hold approximately 10000 textual items.  We are in the process of integrating these text into the [HXWD](https://hxwd.org) project, but this has just started and the support is quite rudimentary. 
The display of full text search results described in [[Search results]] has acquired a new direct link that allows convenient search without leaving the HXWD website.
